### Professional Reflection

###### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

Yes. Splitting the work evenly, constant communication, leader check up in intervals, teammates double checking with each other.

Personal example: UEM project for unimelb. Split up different tasks, identify due dates. Although we didn't have a leader, everyone was initiative. Every once in a while, someone will say 'okay we need to do this, this, and this'. Most of the time, people will say "ill do this task", but if not, sometimes a person will just ask someone who didn't do as much 'can you do this section'. We remind each other deadlines and ask if finished on our own part. 

###### 

###### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

Treat others as how you would treat yourself. Address everyone with respect. Keep it professional.

###### 

###### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

Keep being respectful with everyone. Its okay to chat a bit. Makes atmosphere lighter and more enjoyable.

###### 

###### How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

Prepare beforehand. Know what's going to be discussed. Search up any terms or simple processes before the meeting.



###### Provide practical steps or examples of how you've communicated clearly or respectfully in the past, or plan to in the future.

###### Include examples of how you personally make meetings productive or help create a positive work environment (beyond just 'being respectful').

Made sure everyone gets work. Make sure to say 'good job' when they finished their task. Dont be afraid to criticize their work, but make sure to be polite. Ask for help when you need it. Make sure to ask about teammates work process. See if they are on task.  

###### 

###### What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Keep asking questions. Always looking for things-to-do and suggest it with supervisor. Then can start right away. Ask anything if you have any doubts.

###### 

###### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

Email – for general comms (expect a reply within 48 hours)

Discord/Teams – for medium-priority stuff (need a reply within 24 hours)

SMS – urgent (need a response within 2 hours)

Call – true emergency



###### What are some things you won't do?

I won't treat people disrespectfully and will keep things professional.
