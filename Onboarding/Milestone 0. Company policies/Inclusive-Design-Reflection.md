### Inclusive design reflection

###### 

###### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

People with ADHD/autism --> might not be able to focus on a task, distracted, physically disabled --> might not be able to control/use all functions, elderly/bad at technology --> might not find the next step (gulf of execution), mentally ill people --> might feel more vulnerable to everything, see the world in a different view.

###### 

###### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

ADHD: Have a cleaner interface, less distractions, have checkpoints.

Autism: Not too vivid (no sensory overload), consistant elements.

###### 

###### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

Have a clean, minimalistic interface, use gentle and direct language/reminders, and use consistant elements.

###### 

###### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

Consider the other persons circumstance, understand everyone is different.

Keep it respectful. Clear communication. Understand everyone makes mistakes, allow room for error.

###### 

###### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

Use softer tone. Be more understanding. Chat more. have more patience when talking to others. ask to help. 

###### 

###### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

UX: Unintuitive interface, too many features at once.Do not have a lot of different sections, multiple asides, divs, navigation, footer, all with vibrant colors all in view at once. It will be too much for the user. 

Communication: Does not help/support users with questions and issues they bump into. Does not take user recommendations and work on them.

###### 

###### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

Document and comment clearly on code/changes. be respectful and be more understanding.





###### Reading done: https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ybm31u/productivity\_apps\_are\_bad\_because\_people\_keep/

short summary: 

user dislikes ads in productivity apps. defeats the purpose of focusing. User feels like productivity apps are too focusing on normal workflows with bigger tasks like finish assignment 1, whereas user just wants something to help her track smaller daily tasks like watering plants, brush teeth. 





###### Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

Trying out "ask for help" section and its stuck at a loading page saying "Initializing embedded services..." Maybe server is down? dont know

Have to fix. Also, i think we should have a common Q\&A section. Maybe the problem has come up before for other users.
