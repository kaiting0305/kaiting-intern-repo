### Cyber Security Guidelines



###### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

Already used the default password manager on chrome. Already lock screen when I leave my laptop. Already set up auto turn off screen after 3 min.

###### 

###### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

Password manager--> it does it automatically. Setting up screen auto turn off when inactivity. Have auto lock and biometric (already)

###### 

###### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

Dont use same passwords for everything, keep using a password manager, always be aware of phishing or suspicious links. 

Check sender email carefully.

###### 

###### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

Email or message the team/supervisor about the security breach. Change password.



###### One new cybersecurity habit:

Ever since I chose one of my gmails as a 'work' account, I have been more cautious to use it. Using other accounts to apply for non important things, more cautious in this gmail.
