### AI usage guidelines





###### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

Use ai for assistance when need more information and when learning. Use actual skill for relevant work and sensitive data.

###### 

###### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

Only use ai to learn. Do not copy code/info over. Learn from it and implement it yourself.

###### 

###### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

Do not input any passwords or sensitive information. If inputting data, use dummy data.





1. I will use AI to teach me how to do things. Especially technical things like connecting repositories etc.
2. I will not input large amounts of code from Focus Bear, any passwords, or API keys.



Specific example:

Used AI in researching cyber security guidelines. I used clause ai. It gave me quite a bit of response. I read through everything and chose the main points to write about in my document. It did not need much double checking as this is a generic question and not exactly a sophisticated question. AI saves time by doing research and providing me with information I need in a personalized way.
