### OHS laptop ergonomics

###### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

Use an additional monitor, and laptop stand

###### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

Remind myself to sit straight, walk and take breaks every hour

###### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

Use focus bear!



###### Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

I now have an extra monitor set up and a laptop stand.
