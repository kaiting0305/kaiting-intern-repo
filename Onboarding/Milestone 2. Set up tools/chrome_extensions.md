### Chrome Extensions

###### 

##### Which extensions did you install? Why?



###### I installed the following chrome extensions:

###### React Developer Tools (inspect React components).

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore.

I tried this on focusbear.io but it seems like focus bear does not user React. I tired it on react.dev. It will map all react components and their heirarchy. clicking on each react component will show the props(data passed in) and state (internal data). Profiler is used by start recording a profiler, then clicking around the website. It is used to see how long it takes for the page to load and which components are time consuming. 

###### 

###### Redux DevTools (debug Redux state).

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore.

I tried to use redux on focusbear, react.dev, youtube, goodle docs, apple.com, transport.vic.gov, students.unimelb. All of these dont work and appear with the same message. According to claude.ai, the tool is working fine but these websites just dont use Redux so nothing is showing up. 

###### 

###### A JSON Viewer (pretty-print API responses).

I got JSON Formatter. JSON Viewer, JSON Formatter, and JSONView all work and do pretty much the same thing. JSON Formatter has the most users so I chose this one.

This works automatically after download. I now have collapsible sections, syntax highlighting, and clickable links.

###### Lighthouse (performance auditing for web apps).

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?utm\_source=item-share-cb

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore.

I tested Lighthouse on the focusbear.io website. It shows the score, the metrics, the insights, the diagnostics, the passed audits, etc. Performance is about how fast it takes for the website to load. Accessibility is how usable it is for disabled people and keyboard navigation. best practices checks if website follows modern web standards. SEO checks if google can find and index this site well. 



##### What was the most useful thing you learned?



Lighthouse can assess how a website performs in 4 different categories. Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. It can score it out of 100 and even provide insights to which improvements are deemed more important than others. With this tool, it could be a used to determine the shortcomings of the website and have improvement suggestions.

I talked with Jeremy and he said that focus bear doesn't really use React and Redux. The onboarding will need to be updated.
