### Chrome Extensions

###### 

##### Which extensions did you install? Why?



###### I installed the following chrome extensions: 

###### React Developer Tools (inspect React components).

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore.

###### 

###### Redux DevTools (debug Redux state).

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore. 

###### 

###### A JSON Viewer (pretty-print API responses).

I got JSON Formatter. JSON Viewer, JSON Formatter, and JSONView all work and do pretty much the same thing. JSON Formatter has the most users so I chose this one. 

###### 

###### Lighthouse (performance auditing for web apps).

This seems to be the only one on chromewebstore. 



##### What was the most useful thing you learned?



React DevTools lets us see the component tree and props/state in real-time. I can find out what went wrong if something breaks in front end. 

JSON Formatter makes API response readable
