### Git knowledge



###### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I used it in my Object oriented software development class in university. Used it as a version control. Saved game/code progress. 



###### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I have used terminal/powershell. It is the most basic one. I also used the git integration built into VS code. It is extremely convenient to use when working in VS code. 



###### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

I learned about how to go back to different commit timestamps. I have committed before but I never really needed to go back in time to a previous committed state so I never learned about it. I learned 'git log'. I reviewed more about creating branches, merging, and pull requests.
