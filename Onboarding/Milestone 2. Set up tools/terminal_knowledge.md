### Terminal Knowledge



###### Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I'm using powershell because it is preinstalled for Windows and gets the job done. Terminal is like a wrapping. It can contain powershell, cmd, and bash at the same time. I'll stick with powershell because its basic and all I need. Dont wanna overcomplicate things. 



###### What customizations (if any) did you make?

I did not make any customizations. I want to learn the basics before adding too much optional/customizations. Maybe until im more familiar with the working environment will I add customizations. 



###### What was the most useful command you learned today?



git remote -v: checks which repositories are connected. 

git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and enters branch



Also learned difference between absolute path and relative path in terminal. Can be useful when changing dir.
