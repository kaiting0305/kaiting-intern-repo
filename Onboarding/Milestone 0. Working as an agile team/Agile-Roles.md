### Agile roles



###### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

I am a back end developer. We write code, fix bugs, build features, review each others code, estimate task time length, and deploy/maintain the system. We build APIs and server side logic as well as database design and management. We will also integrate our app/website with third party services. 

###### 

###### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

We discuss with PM on what to build. 

We provide API for Front end developers

QA will test our code and inform us any bugs

We listen to Agile PM and clarify meeting times

###### 

###### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

Back end dev pick tasks from sprint meetings and work on them. We try to complete it before the next sprint (depends on task difficulty) and update in daily standups. We are the makers of the team making the functionality of the app.  

###### 

###### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

We will collaborate frequently with the QA team because they report to us what bugs there are. We can improve teamwork by increasing the amount of communication between the two teams
