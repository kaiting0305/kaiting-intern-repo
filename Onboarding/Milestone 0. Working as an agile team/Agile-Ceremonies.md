### Agile Ceremonies



###### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Helps keep everyone updates on what each person is doing. Keeps the team aligned. Distributed work (no overlap), reduces confusion, better estimates or time till completion.

###### 

###### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

I think daily standups are most important since the back end developer is mostly done remotely. It is really flexible so its better to keep the team updated on what my progress is. Our team may often block others so having updates is better.

###### 

###### Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.

Attended 3 standup meeting so far. Sometimes Jeremy takes lead and goes around asking everyone how their progress is. If Jeremy is not in meeting, then we just go off and update the group one by one.



###### Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one

###### 

###### Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

In my last daily standup meeting, I did not say what I will be working on (near future). It was also my first meeting and had trouble with my microphone. I need to come in prepared.
