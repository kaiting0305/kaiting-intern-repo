### Agile principles



###### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

Benefits: We get more feedback, is more flexible. Can know if we are moving in the wrong direction or getting off track earlier on.

Challenges: Less predictable, more chaotic



###### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Lets me know if I'm working on the right thing. Constant feedback. Gives more security.



I have been following the agile principles in a sense where I attend daily standups during the days I work and tell them what I did and what I will be doing. I have been keeping up to date and keeping them informed. 



###### Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

Scrum: have "sprints" (biweekly) with regular meetings (daily standups)

Kunban:  more constant with work, visualize work on board, limited task in progress



I notice focus bear utilizes both of these concepts. We have biweekly sprints and daily standups on days that we work. We also have a visualization board for us to clearly understand which tasks we are working on and which ones we will work on in the near future. 



###### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

Having constant feedback to get feedback early on and change things if necessary. Can ask for advice and direction before putting in a lot of effort only to realize it's not what we want.
