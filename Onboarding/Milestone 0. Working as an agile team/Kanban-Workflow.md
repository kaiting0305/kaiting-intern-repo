### Kanban Workflow



###### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban keeps things clear. We can see which tasks to do. We can also limit amount of tasks that are 'working' on.

###### 

###### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

It can limit how many tasks I work on. I will need to get those done. I will also have a clear view of what tasks to do next.

###### 

###### Check out Focus Bear's Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

Checked.

###### 

###### Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

I created a kanban board in my own repo since there was only one project currently in the Focus bear projects that I have access to. There are different issues that i need to complete in my Kanban board. I moved all issues from backlog to 'ready' and moved a 'get access to discord' issue to 'in progress'. I notice that there can be a max of 3 tasks in 'in progress'

###### 

###### Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.

Edit it after I finish each task. Check it daily



Consulted Jeremy about the problem of only seeing one project on Focus bear. He told me to create my own board in my own repo.
