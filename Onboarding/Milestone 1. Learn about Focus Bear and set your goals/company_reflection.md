### Company Reflection 



###### Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Focus bear was created to help with the founders personal problem of being unproductive and unable to stick to habits. \\



"I wanted a tool that would actually force me to get my yoga done instead of scrolling. And I tried everything; parental control apps, hiding my laptop in a cupboard, asking my wife to slap me if she found me on email in the morning.

None of them worked consistently and my cheeks were getting sore.

In desperation, I started working on a new app that would blend the best features from other apps out there. One that would guide me towards better habits while reducing procrastination.

And now I have the solution - Focus Bear."





###### What problem is Focus Bear solving?

It aims to help people with ADHD and autism with discarding distractions, building habits, and increasing productivity



###### Why do you think this mission is important?

Unlike other similar apps, this one takes in mind of how someone with ADHD and autism works. It helps with all the problems in the previous question



###### How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

I personally also have a little ADHD. I get distracted easily and using this app can help me manage my life better. 

I also want to use this opportunity to improve my skills in building app/backend. 

It is also a great opportunity and way to help out the world where I believe can also bring positive changes to other people.

###### Reference concrete details from the Focus Bear website (e.g., their stated mission, vision, or a feature you found interesting).



###### Share a personal story or example of how being distracted or struggling with habits has affected you (or someone you know), and how Focus Bear's approach might help.

I personally have a little adhd and tried using it for myself before. It did help me a bit. The blocking apps thing does help. I find myself annoyed but the 5 seconds of wait time before opening up a distracting app rly did work sometimes. I guess i opened it out of impulse or boredom. but when i stopped and waited and thought about it, i remembered i should not be wasting my time on this game and closed the app. 



###### Expand on how Focus Bear is different from other apps you've tried.

Other apps do not block apps on default, only when in a current session. Focus bear blocks it even when not in session and have to manually stop blocking. Can not use focus bear app while not blocking.
