### Learning Goals



###### What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I want to learn how to do back end and hopefully how to create my own app. Understand the logic behind full stack. Learn about APIs and how it connects fromt he front end to back end to database. 





###### What skills are you most excited to develop?

structure of how a company runs. Logic of full stack and understanding how APIs work. I am completely new to all this so I want to learn about it. 



###### What do you think you can contribute to the team?

After learning about everything in the onboarding, I believe i can help out with bugs, help work on new features. I'm still unsure exactly what I will learn and what I can provide but Im excited to help.

I created a game before in my OOSD class and I found it quite fun. I hope I can use my skill to help improve focus bear app. 



###### What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

My knowledge of being a back end developer. I have only ever created a game in class. Never an actual app. Idk how an app utilized third party apps and I would want to know.



###### What does success in this internship look like for you?

Me learning everything I want within the first 6 weeks, helping Focus Bear with tasks that actually change the app for the better, and (hopefully) getting a high distinction



Being able to see my work used in the app would be considered an achievement for me I would want to see.
