Focus bear is designed specifically for people with ADHD and autism.

Honestly, I would choose Freedom over Focus bear.



###### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Can create different block lists (while focus bear can only have 1 list at a time), focus bear needs to pay for over 25 min. Freedom can schedule blocking while focus bear is 'now'. Freedom can allow me to use my phone to block my laptop. Idk if its my own setting but focus bear background is a bit dark while freedom is more light/positive.
