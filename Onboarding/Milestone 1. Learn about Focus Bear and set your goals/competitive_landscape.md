### Competitive Landscape



##### Downloaded and compared Focus Bear with ***Freedom*** app

###### 



###### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus bear is designed specifically for people with ADHD and autism.



###### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

Honestly, I would choose Freedom over Focus bear. For all of the reasons below. There are more features on Freedom and the default color is more pleasing to the eye for me. 



###### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Can create different block lists (while focus bear can only have 1 list at a time), focus bear needs to pay for over 25 min. Freedom can schedule blocking while focus bear is 'now'. Freedom can allow me to use my phone to block my laptop. Idk if its my own setting but focus bear background is a bit dark while freedom is more light/positive.



###### Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Look at the features in the question above.

Allow focus bear to create different blocklists. Sometimes I work with Instagram to communicate, sometimes i dont. I dont want to keep switching it around inside settings. One click to change blocklist is useful.
