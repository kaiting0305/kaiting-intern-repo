### Git understanding





What i did:

Created a branch and edited a file. added and commited. Went to main and edited the same file same line. added and commited. Merge two branches --> Conflict appears!





###### What caused the conflict?

A conflict arises when two edits of the same file and line occurs in a merge between two branches. The system can not determine which of the two versions to keep



###### How did you resolve it?

I resolved it by opening up the file and manually accepting which version to keep. Removed the markers (VScode automatically does) and add+ commit



###### What did you learn?

I learned that I always have to be careful merging. Merge conflict happens when editing same file and line. It will need manual acceptance of change. I know this thing exists and is aware of this type of problem.
