### Using NestJS CLI for Scaffolding



###### How does the NestJS CLI help streamline development?

With CLI, it will automatically help u create many files in the correct folder placement and setting up the basics of each, including boilerplate code, imports, decorators, and even test files. We will only need to type in one (or few) commands and not creating everything from scratch. This saves time, provides consistency, and prevents errors. It also sets up CRUD endpoints.



###### What is the purpose of nest generate?

Using generate can help us quickly generate the files, (controller, services, tests) and modules in a consistent and fast way. It connects everything together and updates other files accordingly. 



###### How does using the CLI ensure consistency across the codebase?

Since CLI will automate the creation and follows NestJS best practices, it will create consistent code. The formatting, the names of folder/files, everything. Without CLI, people may name their files differently or forget to add imports or test files. 



###### What types of files and templates does the CLI create by default?

CLI can create modules, controllers (with test file), services (with test file), and even resource, which generates a complete CRUD feature. It creates DTOs and entities.
